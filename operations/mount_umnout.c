/*mount()    //  Usage: mount filesys mount_point OR mount
{

1. Ask for filesys (a pathname) and mount_point (a pathname also).
   If mount with no parameters: display current mounted filesystems.

2. Check whether filesys is already mounted:
   (you may store the name of mounted filesys in the MOUNT table entry).
   If already mounted, reject;
   else: allocate a free MOUNT table entry (whose dev=0 means FREE).

3. open filesys for RW; use its fd number as the new DEV;
   Check whether it's an EXT2 file system: if not, reject.

4. For mount_point: find its ino, then get its minode:
    call  ino  = getino(&dev, pathname);  to get ino:
    call  mip  = iget(dev, ino);          to get its minode in memory;

5. Check mount_point is a DIR.
   Check mount_point is NOT busy (e.g. can't be someone's CWD)

6. Record new DEV in the MOUNT table entry;

  (For convenience, store the filesys name in the Mount table, and also its
                    ninodes, nblocks, bitmap blocks, inode_start block, etc.
   for quick reference)

7. Mark mount_point's minode as being mounted on and let it point at the
   MOUNT table entry, which points back to the mount_point minode.

umount(char *filesys)
{

1. Search the MOUNT table to check filesys is indeed mounted.

2. Check whether any file is still active in the mounted filesys;
      e.g. someone's CWD or opened files are still there,
   if so, the mounted filesys is BUSY ==> cannot be umounted yet.
   HOW to check?      ANS: by checking all minode[].dev

3. Find the mount_point's inode (which should be in memory while it's mounted
   on).  Reset it to "not mounted"; then
         iput()   the minode.  (because it was iget()ed during mounting)

4. return 0 for SUCCESS;
